Welcome to Purdue, brave adventurer! You are about to begin a journey the
likes of which you have never seen, set in a familiar yet post-apocalyptic 
college campus.  This world is inhabited by players just like you, trying 
to survive and avoid bloodthirsty monsters. In order to survive you need to 
gather weapons and supplies to aid you. Here are some commands that should 
be of use to you:

'move X' - moves your character in X direction. Valid directions are north, 
              south, east, west, northwest, northwest, southwest, southeast
	     
'search area' - provides you with information about your surrounding area

'inventory' - lists items in the player's inventory

'attack' - attempt to attack an enemy

'flee' - attempt to run from an enemy

'stats' - lists player's stats

'where' - tells the player their current location

'equip X' - equips item X to a usable slot. If the item is a weapon it will
            be equipped in the weapon slot. If there was already a weapon in 
            the weapon slot, it will be replaced by X. There is a weapon slot, 
            a head slot, and a body slot.
	      	
'equipped' - tells the player what is equipped.
