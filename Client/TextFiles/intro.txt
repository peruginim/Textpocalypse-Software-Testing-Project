Welcome to Purdue "brave" Adventurer! You are about to begin a journey the
likes of which you have never seen, unless you have played video games prior
to this one. In that case you've probably seen better but if this is your
first time you will be amazed! This world is inhabited by players just like
you, trying to live without being eaten by some crazy five headed battle toad
or something like that. In order to survive you will need to gather weapons
and supplies to aid you. Here are some commands that should be of use to you:

move X - moves your character depending on what direction you choose. You can use any direction (move north, move
southeast) as long as it is a valid move. 

search area - provides you with information about your surrounding area

inventory - lists out what items are in the player's inventory

who - lists players that are on the same spot as you

attack - attempt to attack an enemy

flee - attempt to run from an enemy

stats - lists player's stats

where - tells the player their current location

equip X - equips the item X to a useable slot. If the item is a weapon it will
be equiped in the weapon slot. If there was already a weapon in the weapon
slot, it will be replaced by X. There is a weapon slot, a head slot, and a
body slot.
